# Torchvision Utilities

The code in this folder is a subset of the [torchvision object detection reference training scripts](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/references/detection/README.md).
The code is not directly accessible from the torchvision install in `requirements.txt`, so the code was 
cloned within this repository for ease of use.
